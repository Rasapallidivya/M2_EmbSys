# DENSITY BASED TRAFFIC SIGNAL SYSTEM

# Description

Nowadays, controlling the traffic becomes major issue because of rapid increase in automobiles and also because of large time delays between traffic lights. So, in order to rectify this problem, we will go for density based traffic lights system. This Project explains you how to control the traffic based on density.

The project is creating a density-based dynamic traffic signal system, in which the timing of the signal changes automatically in response to the density of traffic at any given intersection. In most cities throughout the world, traffic congestion is a major issue, and as a result,It's time to move away from manual mode or fixed timer mode and toward an automated system with decision-making capabilities.capabilities. The current traffic signalling system is based on a fixed time schedule, which may cause delays.If one lane is open while the others are closed, it is inefficient

# Research
Ultrasonic sensors are utilised to assess traffic density in this system. These sensors will always detect traffic on that route. The microcontroller is connected to all of these sensors.The controller detects and regulates the traffic system using these sensors.

# 4W'S and 1H

# WHAT
This project will show you how to use density to control traffic.

# WHEN
When there is a lot of traffic. Areas with a large population.

# WHY
It is not necessary to wait for the other signal if there will be no traffic. That signal will be skipped by the system, and it will move on to the next one.

# WHERE
To control traffic automatically and effectively in high-traffic regions.

# HOW
It uses sensors and a microcontroller to automatically control traffic signals.

# Components Used
Atmega328p
Sensors
Resistors
LED's
SimulIDE
Visual Studio
avr-gcc Make
