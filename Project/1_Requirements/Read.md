# WATER LEVEL INDICATOR:Interfacing with Arduino

# Description

Nowadays, all over India, there is a water crisis. To solve this crisis, we need proper water management on the individual level and we need a water level indicator. By doing water management at the individual level we can save plenty of water and could get rid of the water crisis.

You may have a doubt here about how to do water management individually? Well, it's simple. All we have to do is to use a little sensor in our water storage system i.e. water tank.

The sensor will give you an indication of the water level in your water tank. If you know the water level every time, you can easily turn your water pump ON/OFF as per the need.
# Research
In this, we are going to interface the water level sensor with the Arduino UNO and we are going to measure the water level of the water tank. If the water level will be low it will turn ON the pump, If the water level is high it will turn it OFF.


# How to calibrate Water level sensor?'

To make sure the sensor provides accurate data you need to calibrate the sensor for the particular type of water you are going to use.

Before initiating the project or storing the data in the sensor, you should see what readings you are exactly getting from your sensor.

Make a note of the proper values of your sensor outputs when the sensor is completely dry, when it is partially submerged in the water and when it is completely submerged.

In this calibration, you need to do some trial and error. It will be difficult in starting to calibrate this sensor with accurate values. once you will get the accurate values you can handle the project very well. Now you are ready to start

# 4W'S and 1H

# WHAT
This project will show you how to control the level of water.

# WHEN
When there is a lot of scarcity of water we can use this method.

# WHY
It is not necessary for controlling the water level manually,instead of manual operation for automatic way we use this method.

# WHERE
To control the level of water in water tanks, factories, commercial complexes, apartments, home,Oil tank level control and Pool water level control.
# HOW
It uses sensors and arduinoUno for automatically controlling of water level.

# Components Used
Arduino Uno

Sensor

Resistors

LED's

Potentiometer

SimulIDE

Arduino IDE



# Here Instead of Water Sensor I have used Potentiometer because it is an analog sensor.
